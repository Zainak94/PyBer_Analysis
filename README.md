# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
## Purpose: 

The CEO of the company PyBer has asked me and my partner to work on a new assignment. We had to create a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by each city type and then using Matplotlib, we must create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares in correction with each city type. 

# Results:

•	City Type Rural has number of total rides at 125 and total drivers at 78. Average fare per ride is more compare to suburban and urban areas. Average fare per driver is the highest compare to suburban and urban average fare per driver. 

•	Suburban has number of total rides 625 and total drivers at 490. Average fare per ride falls in between rural and urban. 

•	Urban has number of total rides 1625 and total drivers at 2405. It has the highest total fares and the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver. 
Overall, for urban the fares are low for both drivers and per ride, but total riders and drivers are the highest. The reason for this is because urban areas are highly populated.

•	City Type: Rural: The peak of the rides in correlation with the fares were more in April and last week of Feb. The highest is $500 in fares in April. 

•	City Type: Suburban: The peak of the rides in correlation with the fares were highest in last week of Feb. It goes up to $1400-$1450.

•	City Type: Urban: The peak of the rides in correlation with the fares were highest last week of Feb and 1st week of March. The fares go up to $2500. 

•	Overall, in total fare by city type, we can tell that the highest ride-sharing data is in Urban area. The highest fare goes up to $2500. 2nd highest ride sharing data is in suburban area and last is the rural area. Urban area is usually highly populated compare to the suburban and rural areas. 

# Summary: 
There are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1.	Ride sharing data is the highest in Urban areas. The CEO should continue to provide more drivers to urban areas as we can see that it has the greatest number of riders which will help increase the fares per ride as well. 

2.	In Rural city type, the CEO should consider increasing in the total number of drivers. The total number of drivers increase so maybe the fare per ride will increase as well. 

3.	In Urban city type, the CEO should consider increasing the average fare per driver.
